# CALCULATOR 
Hello Visitor!
In this basic calculator,i have done many error handling:

0100+1=101

if first input is 0 and second is non-zero number,then in the display screen,the non zero number will be only display.

no consecutive repetition of operators

first input cann't be * or /

only integer type allowed



NOTE- it follows bodmas rule
